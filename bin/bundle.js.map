This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.

Among\n * other things, this allows you to animate CSS properties.  For example, you\n * can do this:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90xp)' }\n *     });\n *\n * `translateX(45)` will be tweened to `translateX(90)`.  To demonstrate:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90px)' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will log something like this in the console:\n *\n *     translateX(60.3px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(76.05px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(90px)\n *\n * Another use for this is animating colors:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { color: 'rgb(0,255,0)' },\n *       to: { color: 'rgb(255,0,255)' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.color);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will log something like this:\n *\n *     rgb(84,170,84)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(170,84,170)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(255,0,255)\n *\n * This extension also supports hexadecimal colors, in both long (`#ff00ff`)\n * and short (`#f0f`) forms.  Be aware that hexadecimal input values will be\n * converted into the equivalent RGB output values.  This is done to optimize\n * for performance.\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { color: '#0f0' },\n *       to: { color: '#f0f' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.color);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * This snippet will generate the same output as the one before it because\n * equivalent values were supplied (just in hexadecimal form rather than RGB):\n *\n *     rgb(84,170,84)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(170,84,170)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(255,0,255)\n *\n * ## Easing support\n *\n * Easing works somewhat differently in the Token extension.  This is because\n * some CSS properties have multiple values in them, and you might need to\n * tween each value along its own easing curve.  A basic example:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will create values like this:\n *\n *     translateX(11.56px) translateY(11.56px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(46.24px) translateY(46.24px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n *\n * In this case, the values for `translateX` and `translateY` are always the\n * same for each step of the tween, because they have the same start and end\n * points and both use the same easing curve.  We can also tween `translateX`\n * and `translateY` along independent curves:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad bounce' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will create values like this:\n *\n *     translateX(10.89px) translateY(82.35px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(44.89px) translateY(86.73px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n *\n * `translateX` and `translateY` are not in sync anymore, because `easeInQuad`\n * was specified for `translateX` and `bounce` for `translateY`.  Mixing and\n * matching easing curves can make for some interesting motion in your\n * animations.\n *\n * The order of the space-separated easing curves correspond the token values\n * they apply to.  If there are more token values than easing curves listed,\n * the last easing curve listed is used.\n * @submodule Tweenable.token\n */\n\n// token function is defined above only so that dox-foundation sees it as\n// documentation and renders it.
